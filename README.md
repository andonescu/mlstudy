# Datasets

There's no machine learning without something to learn. This section contains a list of places where you can find datasets useful for a ML study group / course / training.

* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Large collection of datasets, many of them already explored and explained by other community members.
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html): Loads of datasets, with the suitable technique (regression, classification, etc) pointed out for each of them.
* [Google research datasets](https://research.google.com/research-outreach.html#/research-outreach/research-datasets)
* [AWS-hosted Public Datasets](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/): Quite large datasets, but many interesting ones containing real world data

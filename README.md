# Welcome

# Syllabus

## 1: Intro

Getting to know each other, discussing the plan, the guidelines for sharing the assignments, etc.


## 2: Linear Regression

Create simple prediction models from small datasets.

### Recommended datasets: 
* [House prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data): Predict the price of a house based on surface, lot size, #bathrooms, #bedrooms, etc.
* [Titanic survivability](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic): Predict the likelyhood of someone surviving the sinking of the Titanic based on their gender, age, passenger class and some other variables.
* [Video Game sales with ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings): Predict how well a game will sell based on the critic rating, user rating, publisher and genre.

## 3: Classification

Go over binary classification problems and some algorithms for solving them, e.g logistic regression.

### Recommended datasets:

* [Rotten Tomatoes moview reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews): predict whether the review is positive or not (ant not the score itself).
* [Amazon Fine Foods reviews](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html): multivariate regression: predict whether the review is positive or not *and* whether other users find it helpful.
* [Credit card fraud detection](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud): predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
* [HR Analytics - When will an employee leave the company](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics): predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.


## 4: Clustering

Solve some simple multiclass clustering prodblems with K-nearest neighbors/K-means.


## 5: Recommendations

Create a model for product recommendations with collaborative filtering.


# Datasets

There's no machine learning without something to learn. This section contains a list of places where you can find datasets useful for a ML study group / course / training.

* [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Large collection of datasets, many of them already explored and explained by other community members.
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html): Loads of datasets, with the suitable technique (regression, classification, etc) pointed out for each of them.
* [Google research datasets](https://research.google.com/research-outreach.html#/research-outreach/research-datasets)
* [AWS-hosted Public Datasets](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/): Quite large datasets, but many interesting ones containing real world data
* https://datahub.io
* [The default sci-kit learn datasets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/)
* [mldata.org dataset repository](http://mldata.org/repository/data/)
